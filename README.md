-  3/19/2018 Dev Duplex : The react server has been added, the 'client' folder.  Basically in dev envrionment we have two servers running, react frondend and node js backend.  They are able to comm properly via proxy packages, thus elimnating CORs / Cookies issues.  Servers consolidated on production push, as react is built before pushing.
