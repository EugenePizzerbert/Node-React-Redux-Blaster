-  3/19/2018 A Dev Duplex, React Server and Node(express) Server working in harmony : The react server has been added, the 'client' folder.  Basically in dev envrionment we have two servers running, react frondend and node js backend.  They are able to comm properly via proxy packages, thus elimnating CORs / Cookies issues.  Servers consolidated on production push, as react is built before pushing.
